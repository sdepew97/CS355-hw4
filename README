Assumptions when Coding:
* In the non-preemptive scheduling algorithms, FIFO and SJF, when a new thread is created, it is blocked. If we do not join the thread,
then it remains blocked and will never run. Only upon a thread_join is the thread able to run and the scheduler called.

Nodes:
* My log is found in log.txt
