Assumptions when Coding:
* In the non-preemptive scheduling algorithms, FIFO and SJF, when a new thread is created, it is blocked. If we do not join the thread,
then it remains blocked and will never run. Only upon a thread_join is the thread able to run and the scheduler called.

Notes:
* My log is found in log.txt
* I ran the Ziting tests and took care of the deadlocking cases by returning errors for these cases; I didn't want to deadlock, so I addressed the issues and simply did not permit the joins to occur

Known Bugs:
* My yielding is not working 100% correctly for threads; I ended up having to sigprocmask too much of my code to allow successful interleaving to occur
